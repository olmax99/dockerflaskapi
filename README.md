# Docker Flask API [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org//olmax99/dockerflaskapi.png)](https://travis-ci.org//olmax99/dockerflaskapi)


This is a standalone webbased API project, which exposes data on loan payments from
a postgreSQL database to multiple RESTful API endpoints.

The application can be deployed anywhere Docker can be deployed to. Tests are performed
using the lightweight pytest framework. The ORM is set up in SQLAlchemy directly applying
the flask declarative base approach.

It should be fairly easy to replace the logic for loan payments with any other.

### Prerequisites

+ Pyenv
+ Pipenv integrated with Pyenv
+ Python Version 3.7.1 installed via Pyenv
+ Docker installed

#### Installing

Pyenv and Pipenv is the new way to go for Python version control and virtual environments. Visit
[SecretOfPythonPath](https://github.com/olmax99/secretofpythonpath)
project for how to get started.

Docker should be installed on the system, else please read the [official Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/).


## Quickstart

#### 1. Preparing the project environment

1. In the terminal:
+  Verify that there is a file `python.version` present in the `dockerflaskapi/loansapp` directory. Its
content should be `3.7.1`. This is a file generated by Pyenv. It can be created with `$ pyenv local 3.7.1`.

In the directory  `dockerflaskapi/loansapp`:

```
$ pipenv install
$ pipenv shell

(loansapp)$ pipenv install Flask
(loansapp)$ pipenv install flask-restplus
(loansapp)$ pipenv install sqlalchemy
(loansapp)$ pipenv install psycopg2
(loansapp)$ pipenv install pytest

```

2. In PyCharm:

In PyCharm > Settings > Project Interpreter:
+ Verify that the Project Interpreter `Pipenv(loansapp)` is selected.

*NOTE:*   PyCharm should be opened with the loansapp directory as the top folder. Otherwise the pipenv interpreter
  might behave in an unexpected way.

In PyCharm > Tools > Python Integrated Tools > Testing

+ Set default test runner: pytest

*NOTE:*   Installing from PyCharm or even from both terminal and PyCharm should make no difference.
  Ensure that *Pipfile.lock* is up-to-date. In Pipfile directory simply run `$ pipenv lock` for creating a new
  `Pipfile.lock`.


#### 2. Create the database credential files

There are two files containing the database access credentials that must be created manually.
From the terminal:

**NOTE:** All values provided here **need** to exactly match the values provided in the `.env` file.

Inside the `dockerflaskapi` directory:

`$ vim .env.development`

.env.development
```
# parameters need to match with those of .env file, which defines Postgres credentials
POSTGRES_URI=postgres+psycopg2://flask:super_secret@postgres/flask_api

```

i.e. .env
```
DEV_DB=flask_api
DEV_USER=flask
DEV_PASSWORD=super_secret


```

The respective hosts are simply the service names as indicated in the docker-compose.yml file.


#### 3. Run the project

##### 1. Set the applications run mode

There are two ways of running the app in development mode. By default the `web` container will
run in sleep, and flask is invoked in debug.

If you want to run the Flask app directly from nginx/uwsgi, comment out the line `command: ...` 
in `dockerflaskapi/docker-compose.development.yml`:

```
# Define RUN_MODE="DEV" or "TEST" in .env.override
# command: pipenv run flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000
# Infinite loop, to keep it alive, for debugging
# command: bash -c "while true; do echo 'sleeping...' && sleep 10; done"  <-- COMMENT OUT

```

##### 2. Build and run the docker image in development

```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.development.yml up -d --build

```

##### 3. Load the data into the database

From the project directory `dockerflaskapi/` run the following command:

```
$ cat loansproject_data.dump | docker exec -i dockerflaskapi_postgres_1 psql -U flask flask_api

```

There is a postgreSQL database manager running in docker. Simply access it in your browser at
`localhost: 8000` using the access credentials above and

- Email: pgadmin4@pgadmin.org
- Password: pgadmin

Inside PgAdmin Dashboard go to 'Quick Links' > 'Add New Server'. Under 'General' provide any Name,
e.g. 'Loans Project Dev'.

Under 'Connection' provide 'Host: postgres', 'Username: flask', 'Password: flaskdb', and 'Save'. You
can now access the database tables.

##### 4. Run the web application

In directory `dockerflaskapi/dockerloansapp` run the following command:

```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.development.yml exec web sh -c 'pipenv run flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000'

```

The Swagger Api documentation can be accessed in your browser at `localhost:80`.


## Running the tests

TravisCI is preconfigured to run automated tests on:

- PRs related to merges into master or any branch named `ci-<name>`
- `git push` changes into master or any branch named `ci-<name>`

For manually running the tests:

### Run pytest

In directory `dockerflaskapi`:

```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.testing.yml up -d --build && \
docker-compose -f docker-compose.testing.yml exec web sh -c 'pytest -v --disable-warnings' && \
docker-compose -f docker-compose.testing.yml down


```


## General Instructions

### Changing The Project Name

One of the first tasks when adjusting the business logic for repurposing this project is to
the change following files:

```
# In uwsgi.ini replace the following line:

# module = loansapi.api
module = <your project>.api


# In docker-compose.development.yml
environment:
  # - FLASK_APP=loansapi/api.py
  - FLASK_APP=<your project>/api.py

#In .travis.yml change the environment variables:
env:
  # - APP_DIR="$TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR/loansapp"
  - APP_DIR="$TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR/<your project>"

# Rename the parent directory
$ cp -r loansapp <your project>
$ rm -r loansapp

```

*NOTE*: It is recommended to use PyCharm for the refactoring the project directories, since all import statements need to
be changed along the way.

### Changing Nginx Configurations

The flask docker is based on a project from *Sebastián Ramírez* [uwsgi-nginx-flask-docker](https://github.com/tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx-flask-docker). 

A few adjustments have been made on the way, but all configuration and general instruction references are holding for 
this project, too.
