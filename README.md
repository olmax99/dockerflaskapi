# Python Athena Stack [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org//olmax99/dockerflaskapi.png)](https://travis-ci.org//olmax99/dockerflaskapi)

This is a web API project with a capability of distributed background 
workers for reading and storing larger datasets to AWS S3. It is combined 
with a light-weight DWH system utilizing AWS Athena.

--- 

**Project Design**

![Graph](images/dockerflaskapi.png)

## Prerequisites

For local development, the following components are required on the local machine:

+ Pipenv
+ Python Version 3.6.9
+ Docker installed [official Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/)
+ Docker-Compose
+ RexRay Docker Plugin s3fs [https://rexray.readthedocs.io/en/stable/](https://rexray.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
+ aws-cli installed [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)

---


**NOTE:** Currently, Celery will fail on Python 3.7 due to conflicting 
naming of packages using `async`, which is now a keyword in Python. 
Temporarily downgraded to `3.6.9` until solved.


## I. Quickstart Development

---

**NOTE:** For demonstration purposes, this project assumes the [https://github.com/olmax99/serverlessbaseapi](https://github.com/olmax99/serverlessbaseapi) 
project as the data source and to be up and running.

### 1. Preparing the project environment

In PyCharm:

In PyCharm > Settings > Project Interpreter:
+ Verify that the Project Interpreter `Pipenv(webflaskapi)` is selected.

*NOTE:*   PyCharm should be opened with the webflaskapi directory as the
  top folder. Otherwise the pipenv interpreter might behave in an 
  unexpected way.

In PyCharm > Tools > Python Integrated Tools > Testing

+ Set default test runner: pytest

*NOTE:*   Installing from PyCharm or even from both terminal and 
  PyCharm should make no difference. Ensure that *Pipfile.lock* is 
  up-to-date. In Pipfile directory simply run `$ pipenv lock` for 
  creating a new `Pipfile.lock`.


### 2. Prepare the environment files and external tools

#### a. Docker-compose environment files

There are two files required that are containing the database access credentials 
that need to be created manually.

From the terminal:

**NOTE:** All values provided here need to match the values provided in
the `.env` file.

Inside the `dockerflaskapi` directory:

```
$ vim .env.web.dev

# parameters need to match with those of .env file
REDIS_URI=redis://:super_secret2@redis.flaskapi:6379/0
CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://:super_secret2@redis.flaskapi:6379/0
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND=redis://:super_secret2@redis.flaskapi:6379/0

$ vim .env.worker.dev

CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://:super_secret2@redis.flaskapi:6379/0
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND=redis://:super_secret2@redis.flaskapi:6379/0
PERMITS_URL=<cfn-apigateway-public-url>                   <-- Get from 'serverless base api' project
PERMITS_KEY=<x-api-key>                                   <-- Get from 'serverless base api' project
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<aws access id>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<aws secret key>

$ vim .env

REDIS_PASSWD=super_secret2
REDIS_URI=redis://:super_secret2@redis.flaskapi:6379/0

```

#### b. Aws credentials file

**NOTE:** The IAM access credentials need to be created manually. It is
recommended to further reduce the following access policies:

- AmazonS3FullAccess
- AmazonAthenaFullAccess
- AWSCloudFormationFullAccess 

```
$ aws configure --profile <dev name>

# AWS Access Key ID [None]: <dev access id>
# AWS Secret Access Key [None]: <dev access key>
# Default region name [None]: eu-central-1
# Default output format [None]: json

```

**NOTE:** The name of your custom profile needs to match the aws credentials 
in `.env.worker.dev`.

#### c. RexRay s3fs Docker Volume plugin

A s3fs compatible docker volume needs to be created.

```
# Will create an S3 bucket along with a docker rexray volume
$ docker volume create --driver rexray/s3fs:0.11.4 --name flaskapi-dev-rexray-data

# Verify that rexray docker plugin is set up correctly

$ docker plugin ls

# EXPECTED:
# 1e8d8739nm  rexray/s3fs:0.11.4   REX-Ray FUSE Driver for Amazon Simple Storagâ€¦   true

$ docker run -ti -v flaskapi-dev-rexray-data:/data nginx:latest mount | grep "/data"

# EXPECTED:
# s3fs on /data type fuse.s3fs (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,user_id=0,group_id=0)


```

### 3. Run the project

#### 1. Set the applications run mode

There are two ways of running the app in development mode.

1. If you want to run the Flask app directly from nginx/uwsgi, comment 
out the line starting with `command: ...` in `dockerflaskapi/docker-compose.development.yml`:

```
# command: pipenv run flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000
# Infinite loop, to keep it alive, for debugging
# command: bash -c "while true; do echo 'sleeping...' && sleep 10; done"  <-- COMMENT OUT

```

2. If you want to run the application in DEBUG mode for developing on the
code base, uncomment the last line. It is then recommended to run docker 
in detached mode

#### 2. Build and run the docker image in development

```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.development.yml up --build

```

#### 3. Run the web application

**NOTE:** Skip this step if Flask is running directly from nginx/uwsgi

---

Only in DEBUG mode, in directory `dockerflaskapi` run the following command:

```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.development.yml exec web.flaskapi sh -c 'pipenv run flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000'

# OPTIONALLY - view real-time worker logs
$ docker logs -f dockerflaskapi_worker.flaskapi_1

```

**NOTE:** Changes to the code base of the worker will always need a full restart.

---

1. The Swagger Api documentation can be accessed in your browser at `localhost:5000`.
2. Flower can be accessed on `localhost:5555`

#### 4. Create a development table in AWS Athena

```bash
$ aws cloudformation validate-template --template-body file://cloudformation.development.athena.yml

$ aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name flaskapi-dev-athena-01 \
  --template-body file://cloudformation.development.athena.yml

```

Using DBeaver (or any Athena compatible database manager for that matter), 
verify that the partition can be queried:

```sql
SELECT application_number, permit_record_id
FROM dev_flaskapi_01.dev_permits_01
WHERE partitiontime='2019-09-27';


```

**Delete resources:**

```
$ aws cloudformation list-stacks --stack-status-filter CREATE_COMPLETE
$ aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name dev-flaskapi-01

```


## II. Running the tests

TravisCI is preconfigured to run automated tests on:

- PRs related to merges into master or any branch named `ci-<name>`
- `git push` changes into master or any branch named `ci-<name>`

For manually running the tests:

### Run pytest

In directory `dockerflaskapi`:

```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.testing.yml up -d --build

$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.testing.yml exec web.testing sh -c 'pytest -v --disable-warnings'

$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.testing.yml exec worker.testing sh -c 'pytest -v --disable-warnings'

$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.testing.yml down


```

## III. Quickstart Production

Use [https://dbeaver.io/](https://dbeaver.io/) for directly connecting to the Athena Database.

Launch [https://github.com/olmax99/serverlessbaseapi](https://github.com/olmax99/serverlessbaseapi) for 
the Demo endpoint as external data source. 

### 1. Create Project Base Buckets

**NOTE:** Two persistent Buckets are needed for this project to run: 
  1. `flaskapi-cloudformation-eu-central-1` holds all templates and container instance logs
  2. `flaskapi-staging-datastore-eu-central-1` will be connected to the AWS Glue Table and 
  contains the final partitioned data. Latter will then be read in by Athena.

Even after you clean up a project, you want these buckets to persist. Therefore they are NOT
part of the CloudFormation templates. Create them manually.

### 2. Prepare Task Definition

**NOTE**: Currently, Ecs Secrets are NOT implemented. The target endpoint of the loading data
worker job is hard coded. Replace it with your current endpoint parameters.

In `cloudformation/staging/services/cloudformation.flaskapi.web.yml` change the following lines:
  - `PERMITS_URL`
  - `PERMITS_KEY`

```
ContainerDefinitions:
  - Name: worker-flaskapi
    Image: !Sub ${EcrRepoName}/celery-flaskapi
    # Soft limit, which can be escaped
    MemoryReservation: 256
    # TODO: Implement ECS secrets
    Environment:
        - Name: 'CELERY_BROKER_URL'
        Value: !Sub 'redis://:@${RedisHostName}:6379/0'
        - Name: 'CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND'
        Value: !Sub 'redis://:@${RedisHostName}:6379/0'
        - Name: 'C_FORCE_ROOT'
        Value: 'true'
        - Name: 'PERMITS_URL'
        Value: 'https://dk0uwspefe.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dev/permits/all-permits-json'
        - Name: 'PERMITS_KEY'
        Value: 'ReASbdH1cI6H1K0pO3DqW4ZehZHwD0vE92uF3Flt'

```

### 3. Create Elastic Container Registry

#### a. Get an ECR access token and create ECR repositories

**NOTE:** There can be only one registry per AWS account

```sh
$ make ecr

```

#### b. Push images to ECR

**NOTE:** The local images should exist after having build the project for development.

**NOTE:** Currently, there is no automated CI pipeline. For this reason you need to rebuild
and push the images after every code change manually.

```sh
$ export ECR_REPO_PREFIX=<your ECR label>

# Tag Images with the ECR URL prefix
$ make tag

# Push Images
$ make push

```

### 4. Launch ECS Cluster

#### a. Create deployment bucket and upload files

See [Master template](https://github.com/olmax99/dockerflaskapi/blob/master/cloudformation.staging.ecs.master.yml) for 
detailed Bucket specification. Other than that create the Bucket manually.

From project directory
```sh
# OPTIONALLY
$ aws cloudformation validate-template --template-body file://cloudformation/staging/cloudformation.staging.ecs.master.yml

$ make templates

```

#### b. Launch master template

```sh
$ make cluster

```

#### c. Connect to FlaskApi

```sh
# Activate ovpn connection throught network settings
$ make vpn

```

In browser use: 
  - `http://<internal-flaskapi-staging-alb-endpoint>:5000/`
  - `http://<internal-flaskapi-staging-alb-endpoint>:5555/`

**NOTE:** Target location in `flaskapi--rexray-data-vol` needs to be fixed!! Parquet files need
to be located inside the `data folder` before they can be processed into the data store. This would
need to be configured in the rexray configuration inside the container instance `LaunchConfiguration`.

### FAQ ECS

1. How to get details on the cluster node ami in use?

  *`aws ssm get-parameters --names /aws/service/ecs/optimized-ami/amazon-linux-2/recommended --region ${AWS::Region}`

1. What triggers a scale-up or scale-down of the cluster nodes, respectively? How can it be tested?

  * The current autoscaling configuration simply attempts to reach the desired number of nodes. The 
  desired cluster size is defined in `cloudformation.staging.ecs.master` with property `ClusterMinNodes`.
  This means that in the current setup the cluster size is being kept at this size, and does not vary on
  load or any other events.

  Only an `Unhealthy` signal might lead to temporary changes in the cluster size. However, the autoscaling
  will always attempt to get to the desired state.

2. How does a scale-up or scale-down of task containers translates to an scale-up or scale-down of the cluster nodes?

  * Currently, there are no interchangeable effects between the ecs cluster nodes and the task containers,
  other than unhealthy nodes will be replaced by the autoscaling group.


## IV. General Instructions

### Changing The Project Name

One of the first tasks when adjusting the business logic for repurposing this project is to
the change following files:

```
# In uwsgi.ini replace the following line:

# module = flaskapi.api
module = <your project>.api


# In docker-compose.development.yml
environment:
  # - FLASK_APP=flaskapi/api.py
  - FLASK_APP=<your project>/api.py

#In .travis.yml change the environment variables:
env:
  # - APP_DIR="$TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR/webflaskapi"
  - APP_DIR="$TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR/<your project>"

# Rename the parent directory
$ cp -r webflaskapi <your project>
$ rm -r webflaskapi

```

*NOTE*: It is recommended to use PyCharm for the refactoring of the project
directories, since all import statements need to be changed along the way.

### Changing Nginx Configurations

The flask docker is based on a project from *SebastiÃ¡n RamÃ­rez* [uwsgi-nginx-flask-docker](https://github.com/tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx-flask-docker). 

A few adjustments have been made along the way, but all configuration and
general instruction references are holding for this project, too.

### Log in to Production Bastion Host

SSH forward into bastion host in order to further jump through private network instances. You need to 
use the private IP address!

```sh
# Activate the vpn connection in network settings
$ make vpn

$ ssh -A -i /path/to/<VPN Access Key>.pem ec2-user@<Private IP>

```
